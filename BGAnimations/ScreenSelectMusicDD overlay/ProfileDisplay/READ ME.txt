If you want to use your own custom image for your profile then all you need to do 
is add a new image at the root of your save folder of your profile. 
(Example: \Save\LocalProfiles\00000000\Profile Picture.png)

The image must:
- be in png format
- have a resolution of 96x96
- be titled "Profile Picture"
